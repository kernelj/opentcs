== Customizing and extending the kernel application

=== Guice modules

The openTCS kernel application uses Guice to configure its components.
To modify the wiring of components within the application and to add your own components, you can register custom Guice modules.
Modules are found and registered automatically via `java.util.ServiceLoader`.

Basically, the following steps are required for customizing the application:

. Build a JAR file for your custom injection module with the following content:
.. A subclass of `org.opentcs.customizations.kernel.KernelInjectionModule`, which can be found in the base library, must be contained.
Configure your custom components or adjust the application's default wiring in this module.
`KernelInjectionModule` provides a few supporting methods you can use.
.. A plain text file named `META-INF/services/org.opentcs.customizations.kernel.KernelInjectionModule` must also be contained.
This file should contain a single line of text with the fully qualified class name of your module.
. Ensure that the JAR file(s) containing your Guice modules and the implementation of your custom component(s) are part of the class path when you start the kernel application.

For more information on how the automatic registration works, see the documentation of `java.util.ServiceLoader` in the Java class library.
For more information on how Guice works, see the Guice documentation.

=== Replacing default kernel components

The kernel application comes with default implementations for the component interfaces in `org.opentcs.components.kernel`.
These default implementations allow the kernel to fulfil all of its responsibilities, but the default components might not be optimal for a specific use case.
They can be replaced with a custom Guice configuration, which could look similar to the default configuration the kernel application uses:

[source, java]
----
include::{kernel-guiceSrc}/org/opentcs/kernel/DefaultKernelStrategiesModule.java[tags=documentation_configureDefaultStrategies]
----

For every component, `KernelInjectionModule` provides a convenience method for (re)binding the implementation.
To replace e.g. the default `Dispatcher` implementation, simply register a Guice module in which you call `bindDispatcher()`.
The module's implementation could look like this:

[source, java]
----
@Override
protected void configure() {
  configureSomeDispatcherDependencies();
  bindDispatcher(CustomDispatcher.class);
}
----

IMPORTANT: Note that all component implementations are bound as singletons.
This is important for the following reason:
Components may be injected and used at multiple places within the kernel application; at the same time, every component may also have to keep an internal state to do its work.
If they were not bound as singletons, a new instance would be created for every injection, each of them with their own, separate internal state.
Build custom components with that in mind, and implement their `initialize()` and `terminate()` methods appropriately!

=== Developing vehicle drivers

openTCS supports dynamic integration of vehicle drivers that implement vehicle-specific communication protocols and thus mediate between the kernel and the vehicle.
Due to its function, a vehicle driver is also called a communication adapter.
The following sections describe which requirements must be met by a driver and which steps are necessary to create and use it.

==== Classes and interfaces of a driver implementation

.Classes of a vehicle comm adapter implementation

When developing a vehicle driver, the most important classes and interfaces in the base library are the following:

* `VehicleCommAdapter` declares methods that every comm adapter must implement.
These methods are called by components within the kernel, for instance to tell a vehicle that it is supposed to move to the next position in the driving course.
Classes implementing this interface are expected to realize the actual communication with a vehicle, e.g. via TCP, UDP or some field bus.
* `BasicVehicleCommAdapter` may be used as a base class for implementing a `VehicleCommAdapter`.
It primarily provides some basic command queueing.
* `VehicleCommAdapterFactory` describes a factory for `VehicleCommAdapter` instances.
The kernel instantiates and uses one such factory per vehicle type/driver to create instances of the respective `VehicleCommAdapter` on demand.
* `VehicleCommAdapterPanel` instances may be created by a `VehicleCommAdapter` e.g. to display information about the associated vehicle or send low-level messages to it.
* A single `VehicleProcessModel` instance should be provided by every `VehicleCommAdapter` instance in which it keeps the relevant state of both the vehicle and the comm adapter.
This model instance is supposed to be shared by a `VehicleCommAdapter` and all of its `VehicleCommAdapterPanel` instances for mutual updates, and should be updated to notify the kernel about relevant changes.
The comm adapter implementation should e.g. update the vehicle's current position in the model when it receives that information to allow panels to display it.
Likewise, panels may set values that influence the comm adapter's behaviour in the model, e.g. an interval for periodic messages the comm adapter sends to the vehicle.
`VehicleProcessModel` may be used as it is, as it contains members for all the information the openTCS kernel itself needs.
However, developers may use driver-specific subclasses of `VehicleProcessModel` to have comm adapter and panels exchange more than the default set of attributes.

In the class diagram above, the following exemplary classes could have been created by a developer:

* `CustomVehicleCommAdapter` realizes the communication with the actual vehicle and updates the `VehicleProcessModel` when necessary.
* `CustomVehicleCommAdapterFactory` produces instances of `CustomVehicleCommAdapter` on demand.
* Optional: `CustomVehicleCommAdapterPanel` visualizes the vehicle's and/or comm adapter's current state and provides some low-level interaction with the vehicle.
* Optional: `CustomVehicleProcessModel` contains vehicle-specific state information.

==== Steps to create a new vehicle driver

. Create an implementation of `VehicleCommAdapter`:
.. Subclass `BasicVehicleCommAdapter` unless you have a reason not to.
You don't have to, but if you don't, you also need to implement command queue management yourself.
.. Implement the abstract methods of `BasicVehicleCommAdapter` in the derived class to realize communication with the vehicle and to provide driver-specific visualization panels, if any.
.. In situations in which the state of the vehicle changes in a way that is relevant for the kernel or the comm adapter's custom panels, the comm adapter should call the respective methods on the model.
Most importantly, call `setVehiclePosition()` and `commandExecuted()` on the comm adapter's model when the controlled vehicle's reported state indicates that it has moved to a different position or that it has finished an order.
. Create an implementation of `VehicleCommAdapterFactory` that provides instances of your `VehicleCommAdapter` for given `Vehicle` objects.
. Optional: Create any number of implementations of `VehicleCommAdapterPanel` that the kernel GUI should display for the comm adapter.
Create and return instances of these panels in the `getAdapterPanels()` method of your comm adapter implementation.

See the API documentation for more details.
For an example, refer to the implementation of the loopback comm adapter for virtual vehicles in the openTCS source distribution. 

==== Requirements for a vehicle driver to be found at runtime

. Create a Guice module for your vehicle driver by creating a subclass of `KernelInjectionModule`.
Implement the `configure()` method and register a binding to your `VehicleCommAdapterFactory`.
The following example demonstrates how this module's `configure()` method looks like for the loopback driver that is part of the openTCS distribution:
+
[source, java]
----
include::{kernel-guiceSrc}/org/opentcs/kernel/LoopbackCommAdapterModule.java[tags=documentation_createCommAdapterModule]
----

. In the JAR file containing your driver, ensure that there exists a folder named `META-INF/services/` with a file named `org.opentcs.customizations.kernel.KernelInjectionModule`.
This file should consist of a single line of text holding simply the name of the Guice module class, e.g.:
+
[source]
----
org.opentcs.kernel.LoopbackCommAdapterModule
----
NOTE: Background: openTCS uses `java.util.ServiceLoader` to automatically find Guice modules on startup, which depends on this file (with this name) being present.
See the JDK's API documentation for more information about how this mechanism works.
. Place the JAR file of your driver including all neccessary resources in the subdirectory `lib/openTCS-extensions/` of the openTCS kernel application's installation directory _before_ the kernel is started.
(The openTCS start scripts include all JAR files in that directory in the application's classpath.)

Drivers meeting these requirements are found automatically when you start the kernel.

=== Sending messages to communication adapters

Sometimes it is required to have some influence on the behaviour of a communication adapter (and thus the vehicle it is associated with) directly from a kernel client - to send a special telegram to the vehicle, for instance.
For these cases, `Kernel.sendCommAdapterMessage(TCSObjectReference<Vehicle>, Object)` provides a one-way communication channel for a client to send a message object to a communication adapter currently associated with a vehicle.
A comm adapter implementing `processMessage()` may interpret message objects sent to it and react in an appropriate way.
Note that the client sending the message may not know which communication adapter implementation is currently associated with the vehicle, so the adapter may or may not be able to understand the message.

=== Acquiring data from communication adapters

For getting information from a communication adapter to a kernel client, there are the following ways:

Communication adapters may call publish events via their `VehicleProcessModel` instance to emit information encapsulated in an event for any listeners registered with the kernel.
Apparently, listeners must already be registered before such an event is emitted by the communication adapter, or they will miss it.
To register a client as a listener, use `Kernel.addEventListener()`.

Alternatively, communication adapters may use their `VehicleProcessModel` to set properties in the corresponding `Vehicle` object.
Kernel clients may then retrieve the information from it:

[source, java]
----
include::{kernel-testSrc}/org/opentcs/documentation/ReceiveCommAdapterMessageTest.java[tags=documentation_receiveMessageFromVehicle]
----

Communication adapters may also use their `VehicleProcessModel` to set properties in the corresponding `TransportOrder` object a vehicle is currently processing.
This basically works the same way as with the `Vehicle` object:

[source, java]
----
include::{kernel-testSrc}/org/opentcs/documentation/ReceiveCommAdapterMessageTest.java[tags=documentation_receiveMessageFromTransportOrder]
----

Unlike information published via events, data stored as properties in `Vehicle` or `TransportOrder` objects can be retrieved at any time.
