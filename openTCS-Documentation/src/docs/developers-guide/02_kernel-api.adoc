== Using the kernel API

The interfaces and classes required to use the kernel API are part of the `opentcs-api-base` JAR file, so you should add that to your classpath/declare a dependency on it.
(See <<Available artifacts and API compatibility>>.)
The central interface that is usually interacted with is the `Kernel` interface.

To use the kernel API in code running inside the kernel JVM, e.g. a vehicle driver, simply request an instance of `Kernel` to be provided via dependency injection.
You may also work with an instance of `LocalKernel` here, which provides additional methods available only to kernel application components.

To access the kernel API from another JVM, e.g. in a client that is supposed to create transport orders or to receive status updates for transport orders or vehicles, you need to connect to the kernel via Remote Method Invocation (RMI).
The easiest way to do this is by creating an instance of the `KernelProxyBuilder` class and letting it build a `KernelProxy` instance for you.
(For now, there isn't much support for user management, so it is recommended to ignore the methods that require user credentials.)
See also the class documentation for `KernelProxyBuilder` in the base API's JavaDoc documentation.

=== Working with transport orders

A transport order, represented by an instance of the class `TransportOrder`, describes a process to be executed by a vehicle.
Usually, this process is an actual transport of goods from one location to another.
A `TransportOrder` may, however, also just describe a vehicle's movement to a destination position and an optional vehicle operation to be performed.

All of the following are examples for "transport orders" in openTCS, even if nothing is actually being transported:

* A classic order for transporting goods from somewhere to somewhere else:
.. Move to location "A" and perform operation "Load cargo" there.
.. Move to location "B" and perform operation "Unload cargo" there.
* Manipulation of transported or stationary goods:
.. Move to location "A" and perform operation "Drill" there.
.. Move to location "B" and perform operation "Hammer" there.
* An order to move the vehicle to a parking position:
.. Move to point "Park 01" (without performing any specific operation).
* An order to recharge the vehicle's battery:
.. Move to location "Recharge station" and perform operation "Charge battery" there.

==== A transport order's life cycle

. When a transport order is created, its initial state is `RAW`.
. A user/client sets parameters for the transport order that are supposed to influence the transport process.
  These parameters may be e.g. the transport order's deadline, the vehicle supposed to process the transport order or a set of generic, usually project-specific properties.
. The transport order is activated.
  Its state is set to `ACTIVE`.
. The kernel's router checks whether routing between the transport order's destinations is possible at all.
  If yes, its state is changed to `DISPATCHABLE`.
  If routing is not possible, the transport order is marked as `UNROUTABLE` and not processed any further.
. The kernel's dispatcher checks whether all requirements for executing the transport order are fulfilled and a vehicle is available for processing it.
  As long as there are any requirements not yet fulfilled or no vehicle can execute it, the transport order is left waiting.
. The kernel's dispatcher assigns the transport order to a vehicle for processing.
  Its state is changed to `BEING_PROCESSED`.
** If a transport order that is being processed is withdrawn (by a client/user), its state first changes to `WITHDRAWN`, then to `FAILED`.
   It is not processed any further.
** If processing of the transport order fails for any reason, it is marked as `FAILED` and not processed any further.
** If the vehicle successfully processes the transport order, it is marked as `FINISHED`.
. Eventually -- after a longer while or when too many transport orders in a final state have accumulated in the kernel's order pool -- the kernel removes the transport order.

The following state machine visualizes this life cycle:

==== Structure and processing of transport orders

image::transport_order_course.png[]

. A `TransportOrder` is created by passing a list of `DriveOrder.Destination` instances to the `Kernel` instance's `createTransportOrder()` method.
.. The Kernel wraps each `Destination` in a newly-created `DriveOrder` instance.
.. These ``DriveOrder``s are themselves wrapped by the kernel in a single, newly-created `TransportOrder` instance in their given order (see figure below).
. Once a `TransportOrder` is being assigned to a vehicle by the `Dispatcher`, a `Route` is computed for each of its ``DriveOrder``s.
These ``Route``s are then stored in the corresponding ``DriveOrder``s.

[start=3]
. As soon as a vehicle (driver) is able to process a `DriveOrder`, the single ``Step``s of its `Route` are mapped to ``MovementCommand``s.
These ``MovementCommand``s contain all information the vehicle driver needs to reach the final destination and to perform the desired operation there.
. The ``MovementCommand``s for the partial routes to be travelled are sent to the vehicle driver bit by bit.
The kernel only sends as many ``MovementCommands``s in advance as is required for the vehicle driver to function properly; it does this to maintain fine-grained control over the paths/resources used by all vehicles.
A vehicle driver may set the maximum number of ``MovementCommand``s it gets in advance by adjusting its command queue capacity.
. As soon as a `DriveOrder` is finished, the `Route` of the next `DriveOrder` is mapped to ``MovementCommand``s.
. Once the last `DriveOrder` of a `TransportOrder` is finished, the whole `TransportOrder` is finished, as well.

==== Using order sequences

An order sequence can be used to force a single vehicle to process multiple transport orders in a given order.
Some rules for using order sequences are described in the API documentation for `OrderSequence`, but here is what you would do in general:

----
include::{kernel-testSrc}/org/opentcs/documentation/CreateTransportOrderSequenceTest.java[tags=documentation_createTransportOrderSequence]
----

As long as the sequence has not been marked as complete and finished completely, the vehicle selected for its first order will be tied to this sequence.
It will not process any orders not belonging to the same sequence until the whole sequence has been finished.

Once the _complete_ flag of the sequence has been set and all transport orders belonging to it have been processed, its _finished_ flag will be set by the kernel.
