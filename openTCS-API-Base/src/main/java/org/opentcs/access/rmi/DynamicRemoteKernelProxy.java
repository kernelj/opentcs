/**
 * Creates proxies that hide the details of communication with a remote kernel, so a client can call
 * methods of the proxy as if it was a kernel instance within the same JVM.
 *
 * <p>
 * If the kernel you want to connect to is running on a host named "foobar", you usually only have
 * to do the following:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * Kernel kernel = DynamicRemoteKernelProxy.getProxy("foobar");
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * You can then use <code>kernel</code> to call methods on the proxy, which will be wrapped by RMI
 * calls internally and forwarded to the remote kernel you connected to.
 * This interface to the kernel can e.g. be used to create transport orders from clients - see the
 * developer's guide for code examples.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The proxy will immediately start polling periodically for events with the remote kernel.
 * You can use a custom event filter and custom intervals and timeouts for polling by calling one of
 * the other <code>getProxy()</code> methods.
 * Using an instance of {@code AcceptingTCSEventFilter} as its event filter (which is the default)
 * will let the proxy receive every event generated inside the kernel without filtering out any of
 * them.
 * To receive all or some of these events in your client code, register an event listener with the
 * proxy by calling its
 * {@link EventSource#addEventListener(EventListener, org.opentcs.util.eventsystem.EventFilter) addEventListener()}
 * method.
 * The proxy will then forward all events that it received and that are not filtered by your event
 * filter to your registered listener.
 * </p>
 *
 * @author Stefan Walter (Fraunhofer IML)
 * @deprecated Use {@link KernelProxyBuilder} instead.
