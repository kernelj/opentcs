/**
 * Describes a process spanning multiple {@link TransportOrder}s which are to be executed
 * subsequently by the same {@link Vehicle}.
 * <p>
 * The most important rules for order sequence processing are:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Only transport orders that have not yet been activated may be added to an order sequence.
 * Allowing them to be added at a later point of time would imply that, due to concurrency in the
 * kernel, a transport order might happen to be dispatched at the same time or shortly after it is
 * added to a sequence, regardless of if its predecessors in the sequence have already been finished
 * or not.</li>
 * <li>The <em>intendedVehicle</em> of a transport order being added to an order sequence must be
 * the same as that of the sequence itself.
 * If it is <code>null</code> in the sequence, a vehicle that will process all orders in the
 * sequence will be chosen automatically once the first order in the sequence is dispatched.</li>
 * <li>If an order sequence is marked as <em>complete</em> and all transport orders belonging to it
 * have arrived in state <code>FINISHED</code> or <code>FAILED</code>, it will be marked as
 * <em>finished</em> implicitly.</li>
 * <li>If a transport order belonging to an order sequence fails and the sequence's
 * <em>failureFatal</em> flag is set, all subsequent orders in the sequence will automatically be
 * considered (and marked as) failed, too, and the order sequence will implicitly be marked as
 * <em>complete</em> (and <em>finished</em>).</li>
 * </ul>
